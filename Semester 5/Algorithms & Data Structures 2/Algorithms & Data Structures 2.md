[Semester:: 5]   •   [Year:: 3]   •   [Completed:: ✅]  •   [ECT:: 3]
# Topics:
- **Disjoint set data structures (union-find), amortized analysis**
- **Augmenting data structures (dynamic order statistics, interval trees)**
- **Computing convex hulls (Graham scan)**
- **Principles of scan-line algorithms (plane sweep)**
- **Dynamic programming. Graph algorithms related to dynamic programming such as the the Floyd-Warshall shortest path algorithm.**
- **Max-flow min-cut and the Ford-Fulkerson method, bipartite graphs and matching.**
- **Brief introduction to Intractability, NP-completeness.**
- **Reduction**

# Midterm Topics:
- Union-Find 
- Amortized Analysis
- Augmenting Data Structures
- Plane Sweep
- Convex Hulls
- Interval Scheduling
- Knapsack
- (Not including Rod Cutting and all pairs shortest paths)

# Midterm Questions:
Questions on all the topics except Plane Sweep were asked about. There were a lot of Pseudo Code which were given for different algorithm:
- Homework 1 Exercise 1
- Amortized Analysis Question, basically asking what is the average cost of the algorithm (Same example which was in the class)
- Convex Hull 2 questions from the Homework (2 Pseudo Code Problems)
- Stating some theories (Could not understand as I did not knew about them)
- Asking where this interval is supposed to be under with a given interval tree
- Left-Most-Interval Pseudo Code
- Knapsack Pseudo Code and to explain its cost and everything
# Final topics:

- Dynamic Programming
- Interval Scheduling
- All Pairs Shortest Paths
- Knapsack
