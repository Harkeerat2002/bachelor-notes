# Topics
- Concepts behind **ray-tracing and rasterization**.      
- **Homogeneous coordinates** and **transformations**. 
- **Intersection of a ray** with simple primitives, such as, **sphere**, **triangle**, **cylinder**, **cone**. Note, we do not expect you to remember formulas for the intersection points by heart but rather carry out the computation.
- **Phong reflectance model** with computation of all necessary ingredients.      
- **Barycentric coordinates** and **applications**
- **Snell’s law**   
- **Rasterization pipeline** 
- **Tasks**, **inputs**, **outputs** of **vertex** and **fragment shaders**. 
- **Texturing**
