# Sampling
- ## Probability
	- **Simple Random Sampling**
		- Subjects are selected from a list of the population at random.
	- **Stratified Random Sampling**
		- The population is divided into a number of groups or strata with a known distribution between the groups. Random sampling is then applied within the strata.
- ## Non-Probability
	- **Convenience Sampling**
		- The nearest and most convenient persons are selected as subjects
	- **Quota Sampling**
		- This type of sampling is used to get subjects from various elements of a population. Convenience sampling is normally used for each element.


# Sampling Bias
- ## Self-Selection Bias
	- **Selecting people that will give me certain answers**
	- Online survey to investigate whether people use computers.
- ## Under-coverage Bias
	- **Some categories aren't well represented**
	- Survey of Swiss uni Students, only one USI student
- ## Survivorship Bias
	- **Asking people opinion because they haven't dropped**
	- Survey about quality of this course, but only to students who didn't drop the course.

# Visualize Distribution

# Measures of Central Tendency
- ## Mean
	- **The average of a data set, found by adding all numbers together and then dividing the sum of the numbers by the number of numbers.**
	- Influenced by outliers
- ## Median
	- **The value that's exactly in the middle of a dataset when it is ordered.**
	- Not strongly influenced by outliers
- ## Mode
	- **The most Frequent Numbers**

# Measure of Dispersion
- **Range**
- **IQR**
- **Absolute Deviation**
- **Standard Deviation**
