# Standard Error of the Mean
- Small values indicate the our sample mean is likely a good reflection of population mean.
- Impractical to compute difficult to collect several samples.
- But it can be approximated using the standard deviation of the sample.

# Inferential Statistics
- **To confirm or dis-confirm hypothesis**

# Z-scores
- Comparison of different distribution to test out the Hypothesis
- It allows direct comparison of values

# Hypothesis Testing
- Testing the Hypothesis 
# One-Tailed vs Two-Tailed Tests
- If we try to predict the direction of an effect, we speak of a one-tailed prediction. Even with slightly lower z-score we can reject the null hypothesis.
