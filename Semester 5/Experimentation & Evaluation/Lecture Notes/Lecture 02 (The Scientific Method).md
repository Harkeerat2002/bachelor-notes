- # Types of Reasoning:
	- ## Deductive Reasoning
		- **Empirical Knowledge** is *pure opinion* "Pure Knowledge" can only come from deduction.
		- **From general to specific**
	- ## Inductive Reasoning
		- Generalizing from set of observed instances
		- **Problem**: Induction by enumeration is not enough. Too few instances give insecure generalization, but its impossible to find all relevant instances.
		- **From specific to general**

- # The Scientific Method (v2)
	- **Observe**
		- Observing a phenomena.
	- **Hypothesis**
		- Make an hypothesis from the observation.
	- **Prediction**
		- Designing an experiment predicting what happens
	- **Test**
		- *Prediction was wrong:*
			- Revise the Hypothesis
		- *Prediction was right*
			- Make further tests to confirm the hypothesis.
			- Write a conclusion based on the experiment.
	- **Theory**

- # Types of Empirical Investigation
	- ## Observational
		- #### Information:
			- **What goes naturally in the world**
			- Observe natural processes (e.g., stars)
			- Take snapshots (e.g., questionnaires)
			- *No influence on what you are observing*
		- ***Relatively Cheap***
		- **Doesn't Manipulate**
			- *It takes snapshots of variables*
			- Confounding variables may not be controlled
			- **Problem:** Correlation research does not allow causal statements.
	- ## Experimental
		- ### Information
			- **Directly manipulate conditions**
			- Design and perform experiments
			- Collect and analyze data
			- *Controlling / Influencing the environment*
		- ***Expensive***
		- **Manipulate the Environment**
			- Meant to look for causation
			- *Confounding variables can be controlled*
			- **Problem:** Experimental setting is often artificial
	
	 **Compromise:** Do experiment, then verify finding in naturalistic observation

- # Correlation vs Causation
	- **Tertium Quid:** Another variable has effect on both proposed cause and outcome.

- # John Stuart Mill
	- ## Agreement
		- Overlapping conditions, same effect
		- if **ABC** -> **abc** and **CDE** -> **cde** then **C** -> c
	- ## Disagreement
		- Missing condition, no effect
		- if **ABC** -> **abc** and **AB** -> **!c** then **C** -> **c**
	- ## Concomitant Variables
		- Stronger condition and effect
		- if **ABC** -> **abc** and **ABCC** -> **abccc** then **C** -> **c**
	- ## Residues
		- Individual conditions don't show effect
		- if **ABC** -> **abc** and **A** -> **a!c** and **B** -> **b!c** then **C** -> **c**
