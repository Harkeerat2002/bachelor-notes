# Maximizing Reliability
- **Produce precise measures**
	- Minimize experimental imperfections, produce the same results under the same conditions
- **Have an objective definition of what is measured**
	- *Often Clear-cut*
		- E.g., execution time as a measure for performance
	- *Definition by consensus*
		- Experts agree on "true instances"
	- *Provide operational definition*
# Non-Parametric Scales of Measurements
- **Nominal Categorical Scale**
	- *Set of categories (names) with no order, e.g., male and female, colors*
		- Very little statistics can be performed, it's mostly about counting
- **Ordinal Scale**
	- *Set of ordered categories (sequence)*
		- Ranked Observation, e.g., small, medium, large
		- Slightly better in terms of statistics, we have a direction for differences but not a magnitude.

# Parametric Scales of Measurements
- **Interval Scale**
	- *Ordered Categories in intervals of the same size*
		- Difference in number equals difference in magnitude, e.g., temperature
		- Arbitrary zero point, does not mean absence of value
- **Ratio Scale**
	- *Interval scale with real zero point*
		- Time, distance, weight, errors
		- Allows for meaningful rations (e.g., twice as fast, half as far)
