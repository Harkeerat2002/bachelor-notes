# Possible Questions
- Explain the concept of external validity threats. Use one concrete example in the explanation?
- Describe the idea of a full factorial study design. What are the advantages and disadvantages?
- Explain the difference between a between-group and within-subject design?
- Explain the notion of Mean, Median, and Mode of a distribution. Which of these is more affected by outliers?
- Describe the design of an experiment aimed at -Goal-. Assume you have x participants available to run your study. Clearly report the experimental hypotheses, dependent/independent/blocking variables (if any), the experimental procedure, and the planned data analysis (i.e., which statistics, graphics, tests you plan to report). Are there threats to validity?
