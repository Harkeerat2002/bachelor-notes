# Routing Algorithms
- **Routing Algorithm Goal:** determine *good* paths (equivalently, routes), from sending hosts to receiving host, through network of routers.
	- **Path:** sequence of routers packets traverse from given initial source host to final destination host
	- **Good:** least *cost*, *fastest*, *least congested.*
## Dijkstra's Linked State Algorithm
- **centralized:** network topology, link costs known to all nodes.
	- All nodes have same info
## Distance Vector Algorithm
- **decentralized:** based on an algorithm.
