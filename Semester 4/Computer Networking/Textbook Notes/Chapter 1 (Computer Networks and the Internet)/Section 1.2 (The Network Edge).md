# 1.2 Network Edge

- The Internet hosts - i.e., computer or other device connected to the Internet - constitute that so called **network edge.**

- The computers and other devices connected to the Internet are often referred to as end system.
- They are referred to as end systems because they sit at the edge of the Internet.

## 1.2.1 Access Networks:

- **Access Network:** The network that physically connects an end system to the first router on a path from the end system to any other distant end system.
### **Home Access: DSL, Cable, FTTH, Dial-Up, and Satellite**
Two most prevalent types of broad-land residential access are:
- Digital Subscriber line (DSL)
- Cable

**Digital Subscriber Line (DSL):**
- A DSL internet access is obtained from the same local telephone company which provides its wired local phone access.
- Hence, when DSL is used, a customer’s telecom is also its ISP.

**Cable Internet Access:**
- While DSL makes use of the telecom's existing local telephone infrastructure, cable internet access makes use of the cable television company’s existing cable television infrastructure.
- A residence obtains cable Internet access from the same company that provides its cable television.
- The fiber optics are connected to the cable head end to neighborhood-level junctions, from which traditional coaxial cable is then used to reach individual houses and apartments.
- Since both fiber and coaxial cable are employed in this system, it is often referred to as hybrid fiber coax (HFC).

**FTTH:**
- Although DSL and cable networks currently represent more than 90 percent of residential broadband access in the United States, an up-and-coming technology that promises even higher speeds is the deployment of **fiber to the home (FTTH).**
- It is a concept which mean to provide an optical fiber path from the CO directly to the home.

**Satellite link & Dial-up:**
- A satellite link can be used to connect a residence to the Internet at speeds of more than 1Mbps; StarBand and HughesNet.
- The Dial-up access is over the traditional phone lines which is based on the same model as DSL.

### **Access in the Enterprise: Ethernet and WiFi**
**Ethernet:**
- Although there are many types of LAN technologies, Ethernet is by far the most prevalent access technology in corporate, university, and home networks.
- Ethernet users use twisted-pair copper wire to connect to an Ethernet switch.
- The Ethernet switch, or a network of such interconnected switches, is then in turn connected into the larger Internet.
- With Ethernet access, users typically have 100 Mbps access to the Ethernet switch, whereas servers may have 1 Gbps or even 10 Gbps access.
