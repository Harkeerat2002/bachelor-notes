## 2.2.1 Overview of HTTP
- Until the early 1990s the Internet was mainly used to connect academic institutions.
- In 1994, a new application was born: the World Wide Web (www)
- A web page consists of objects
- Objects can be HTML files, JPEG images, Java applets, audio files, etc.
- A web page consists of base **HTML file,** which includes several **referenced objects**
- Each object is addressable by a **Uniform Resource Locator (URL)**
- **Uniform Resource Locator (URL)**
	- A URL is a “reference to a Web resource that specified its **location** on a computer network and a **mechanism** for retrieving it”

- The client and the server talk to each other by exchanging **HTTP messages**
- The **HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)** is the Web’s application-layer protocol
- ![[Untitled 7.png|450]]
- HTTP relies on a Client/Server Model
	- **Client:**
        - Browser that requests, receives, (using HTTP protocol) and “displays” Web objects
	- **Server:**
	- Web server sends (using HTTP protocol) objects in response to requests
- HTTP uses TCP as its underlying transport protocol.
	- Client initiates TCP connection (creates socket) to server
	- Server accepts TCP connection from client
	- HTTP messages (application-layer protocol messages) exchanged between browser (HTTP client) and Web server (HTTP server)
	- TCP connection closed
- HTTP is stateless
	- HTTP server maintains no information about past clients requests
	- Protocols that, in contrast to HTTP, maintain “state” are complex

## 2.2.2 Non-Persistent and Persistent Connections
- ### HTTP with Non-persistent Connections
	- ![[Semester 4/Computer Networking/Textbook Notes/Chapter 2 (Application Layer)/Attachment/Untitled 8.png]]
	- **Round-Trip Time:**
	- It is the time it takes for a small packet to travel from client to server and then back to the client
	- Time for a small packet to travel from client to server and back
	- The RTT includes packet-propagation delays, packet-queuing delays in intermediate routers and switches, and packet-processing delays.
	- ![[Semester 4/Computer Networking/Textbook Notes/Chapter 2 (Application Layer)/Attachment/Untitled 9.png|550]]
	- HTTP response time
		- One RTT to initiate TCP connection
		- One RTT for HTTP request and first few bytes of HTTP response to return
	- File Transmission Time
		- Non-persistent HTTP response time = 2 RTT + File Transmission time
	- **HTTP with Persistent Connections**
		- *Non-persistent HTTP issues*
			- Require 2 RTTs per object
			- OS overhead for each TCP connection
			- Browsers often open parallel TCP connections to fetch referenced objects.
		- *Persistent HTTP*
			- Server leaves connections open after sending response
			- Subsequent HTTP messages between same client/server sent over open connection
			- Client sends requests as soon as it encounters a referenced object
			- As little as one RTT for all the referenced objects
