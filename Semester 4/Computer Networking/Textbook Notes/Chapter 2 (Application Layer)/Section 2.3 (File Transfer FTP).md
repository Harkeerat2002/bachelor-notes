## FTP:
- The most striking difference (FTP and HTTP) is that FTP uses two parallel TCP connections to transfer a file, a control connection and a data connection. 
- The control connection is used for sending control information between the two hosts—information such as user identification, password, commands to change remote directory, and commands to “put” and “get” files. 
- The data connection is used to actually send a file.
