# IEEE 802.11 Architecture
- wireless host communicates with base station
	- **base station = access point (AP)**
- **Basic Service Set (BSS)** (aka "cell") in infrastructure mode contains"
	- wireless hosts
	- access point (AP): base statiob
	- ad hoc mode: host only
- spectrum divided into channels at different frequencies.
- arriving host: must **associate** with an AP
	- scan channels, listening for beacon framses containing AP's name (SSID) and MAC address
- 802.11: CSMA - sense before transmitting
- 802.11: no collision detection
	- difficult to sense collisions: high transmitting, weak received signal due to fading
	- can't sense all collisions in any case: hidden terminal, fading
	- goal: **avoid collisions:** CSMA/**C**ollision**A**voidance
- **Advanced capabilities:**
	- Rate Adaptation
	- Power Management
- It is a media access control and physical layer specification.
- Extends with common wired Ethernet local network into wirless domain
- **IEEE 802.11's MAC:**
	- Basic Techniques
		- Acknowledgments
		- Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA)
		- RTC/CTC handshake
