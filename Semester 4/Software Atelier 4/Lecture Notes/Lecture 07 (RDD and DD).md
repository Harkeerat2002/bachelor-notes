# RDD and DD
## Responsibility-Driven Design
- RDD is a **design technique** tailored to design **object-oriented software**.
- ### Class Selection Rationale
	- Model Physical Objects
	- Model Conceptual / Domain objects
	- Model Categories
	- Model interfaces to the system
	- Model Values of Attributes
- **Relevance** to the problem still applies.
- Preliminary Analysis yields the following **candidates**, but expect the list to **evolve** as design progresses.
## Domain-Driven Design
- Domain-Driven Design that aims at a rich understanding of the **processes and rules of a domain**, and centering the design on the constructions of an elegant **domain model**.
- Domain experts and developers must speak the same common rigorous language, the so-called **Ubiquitous Language**.
