# OOP, Analysis, and Design
## Object-Oriented Programming
- Everything is an object. Objects communicate by sending and receiving messages. 
- A program in an object-oriented language organizes code through the concept of **class**.
- Classes are software entities whose purpose is to define an **abstract data type**: the **data** (also called state) and the **operations** on such data. 
- **Objects** are instances of classes, and they represent values of the abstract data types represented by the class.
- **Operations** in a class are defined through methods.
	- Methods may **modify** the state;
	- methods may **inspect** the state and **reveal** part of it. (Query/command separations Principle)
- Classes provide **encapsulation**, i.e. they are a mechanism that facilitates the **bundling** of data with the methods (or other functions) of operations on that data. 
- **Inheritance** can be seen as a mechanism to **reuse** previously defined classes in the definition of new classes.
- In OOP, in general, variables can refer to objects of different classes at runtime - this is a form of **polymorphism**. 
## Analysis & Design
**Purpose:**
- How do you structure, model (design a system using object-oriented principles)?
>In **analysis,** we seek to model the world by **discovering the classes and objects** that form the **vocabulary of the problem domain**. 

>In **design**, we **invent the abstractions and mechanisms** that provide the **behavior** that this model requires.
