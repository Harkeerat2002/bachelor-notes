# Software Development Life Cycle (2)
## Extreme Programming:
- **Release Planning**:
    - User Stories:
        - Stories are written by customers like things that the system is expected to accomplish.
    - Architectural Spike:
        - Find the simplest system metaphor which allows explaining the system to new people without resorting to huge documents.
    - Project Velocity:
        - A measure of how much work is getting done on your project over a certain period of time.
        - Used as an indicator to estimate how many user stories can be done before a deadline.
    - Release Plan
        - The development team estimates the ideal developing time (weeks) needed for each user story
        - Customers decide which user stories have the higher priority.
- **Iteration**:
    - Iteration Planning  
        - An iteration planning meeting happens at the beginning of each iteration.
    - Stand-up Meetings  
    - CRC Cards  
    - Unit Test First  
        - Test-Driven Development(TDD)  
	        - *“Fake it till you make it”*
    - Pair Programming
        - All code is created by two people working together at a single computer
        - Roles:
            - Navigator (Reviews the code)
            - Driver (Writes the code)
    - Continuous Integration  
        - Developers should be integrating every code every few hours.
- **Acceptance Test**:
- **Small Releases**:

## Scrum:
It is a framework of rules, roles, events, and artifacts used to implement Agile projects.

**Three Different Frameworks:**
- **Roles**:
    - Product Owner:
        - Could be a customer representative or a customer proxy.
    - Scrum Master:
        - Does whatever necessary to help the team be successful, by supporting the practices of Scrum.
        - Manage the conflict within the team.
        - It is not a Project Manager
    - Scrum Team:
        - A team is typically composed by 5 to 10 people.
- **Ceremonies:**
    - Sprint Planning
        - Takes place at the beginning of each sprint, and sets the goals of the sprint.
    - Daily Scrum Planning
        - A short, 15 minutes meeting that happens every working day, and every team members attends.
    - Sprint Review
        - The team demos the work they have built to team members, scrum master, and product owner.
        - Presentations are not allowed.
- **Artifacts**
    - Product Backlog:
        - Backlog Item
        - Priority
    - Sprint Backlog:
        - Backlog Item
        - Task
        - Owner
        - Initial Estimate
    - Burn-down charts
        - It is a graphical representation of work left to do versus time.
