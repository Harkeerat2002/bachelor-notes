## Lecture 2 Questions:
**What were the decisions that led to the failure of DIA ABS?**
- A change in strategy
- The decision to proceed
- Schedule, scope, budget, commitments
- Acceptance of Change Requests
- Design of the physical building
- The decision to Seek a Different Path

**What were the decisions that led to the issues of the 737 MAX?**
- Physical Design of the aircraft
- The Decision to proceed, using software to fix a physical issue
- Schedule, scope, budget commitments
- Undocumented Software that changed behavior

**What are Software Engineering Best Practices?**
- Develop Software Iteratively
- Manage Requirements
- Use Adequate Architectures
- Separation of Concerns
- Continuously Validate Software

**What is Requirements Engineering?**
- It is the process of defining, documenting and maintaining requirements in the engineering design process.

**Why is Testing Important?**
- Testing is important to find the bugs as quickly as possible, because then it would not be costly to fix them.

**What is Separation of Concerns?**
- It is a design principle for separating a computer program into distinct sections.
- Each section addresses a separate concern, a set of information that affects the code of a computer program

**Why are models of software important?**
- It is important because through the software model, the complexity of the entire software can be analyzed and also the strategy behind the development of the software can be estimated

**Why testing cannot show the absence of bugs?**
- Testing can detect only the presence of errors, not their absence because the main goal of the testing is to observe the behavior of the particular software and to check whether it meet its requirement expectation or not.

**What is software architecture?**
- It refers to the fundamental structures of software system and the discipline of creating such structures and systems.

**Why is it important to track changes?**
- It is important to track changes because if the project heads towards a direction which you do not want to, then it is easy to go back to the change and track back.
- Also, it is easy to debug and see where the error occurred.
