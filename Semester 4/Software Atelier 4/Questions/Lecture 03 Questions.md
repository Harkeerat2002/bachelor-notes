## Lecture 03 Questions:
**What is the main characteristic of the Waterfall Model?**
- They are a family of models.
- Identify phases and activities, forcing linear progression from a phase to the next.
- No returns, considered harmful: cause better planning and control.
- Standardize outputs (artifacts) from each phase: software, like manufacturing.

**In which sense, the Waterfall Model is a family of models?**

**What is the major drawback of the waterfall Model?**
- Requires / Imposes perfect understanding of requirements (that must not change)
- The waterfall by design states that the project has a fixed size and a fix-scoped. However, that is wrong since it never happens like that

**What is the difference between the Waterfall Model and the Spiral Model?**
- The waterfall model is used for smaller projects and projects with clear requirements, while the spiral model is used for large, complex projects that require continuous risk analyzing.

**How can you interpret the waterfall model as an instance of the Spiral Model?**

**What is the role of the prototypes in the spiral model?**
- The role of the prototypes is to enable flexibility and feedback. It tends to be a proof-of-concept which is an approximate of the actual model. Also, through that, feedback is also taken.

**What does the radius of the spiral represent?**
- The radius represents the increasing cost as development goes around.

**What are the main phases in Sync & Stabilize?**
- Planning Phase
- Development Phase
- Stabilization Phase
