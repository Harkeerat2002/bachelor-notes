# Unit 3
- #### Sets:
	- A **set** is a bag of elements, some/all of which could be sets themselves.
- #### Relations and Tables

	- A **relation** is such a table.
- #### Relational Schema
	- **Relation Schema** defines a set of relations.
- #### Keys
	- A set of columns in a relation is a **superkey** if an only any two tuples that equal to the elements of these columns are (completely equal).
	- *A relation always has at least one superkey.*
	- A minimal superkey, is a **key**.
	- Exactly one key is chosen as **primary key**.
	- Other keys are just keys. They are sometimes called **candidate keys**.
	- **Foregin Key** = A binary Many-to-one relationship beteen tables (Partial FUnction)
- #### Implementing an ER diagram as a relational schema
	- Generally, but not always:
		- *An entity set is converted into a table.*
		- *A relationship is converted into a table.*

	- ##### Pattern of Lines
		- The line is *dashed* if the primary key of the *many sides* does not include the primary key of the *one side*.
