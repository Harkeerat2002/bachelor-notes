## Exercise 1-
### <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Name two differences between logical and physical addresses.</mark>
One of the main differences between logical and physical addresses is that the address uniquely identifies a location in the memory. There are two types of addresses, which are logical address and physical address. The logical address is a virtual address which can be viewed by the user. In the end, the main difference between logical and physical address is that the **logical address** is generated by the CPU during the program execution, while the **physical address** refers to a location in the memory unit. 

## Exercise 2- 
### <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Compare paging with segmentation with respect to how much memory the address translation structures require to convert virtual addresses to physical addresses.</mark> 
The main difference between the segmentation and paging is the way that they handle the data. Segmentation tends to require the segment to be in the memory before it is referenced. Otherwise, segmentation and paging is very similar in other regards.
