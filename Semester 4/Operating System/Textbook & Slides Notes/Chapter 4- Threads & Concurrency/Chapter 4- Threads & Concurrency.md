## Overview

- Most modern applications are **multithreaded**
- Threads run **within** applications
- Process creating is heavyweight while thread creating is lightweight
- Can simplify code, increase efficiency
- Kernels are generally multithreaded.

## Multithreaded Server Architecture

A single-threaded and multi-threaded process

- Applications can also be designed to leverage processing capabilities on multicore systems.
- Such applications can perform several CPU-intensive tasks in parallel across multiple computing cores.
- Many applications can also take advantage of multiple threads, including basic sorting, trees, and graph algorithms.

Multi-threaded server architecture

### Benefits

The benefits of multi-threaded programming can be broken down into four major categories:

1. **Responsiveness:** May allow continued execution if part of the process is blocked, especially important for user interfaces.
2. **Resource Sharing:** Threads share resources of process, easier than shared memory or message passing.
3. **Economy:** Cheaper than process creating, thread switching lower overhead than context switching.
4. **Scalability:** Process can take advantage of multi-processor architectures

## Multicore Programming

- A trend in system design is to place multiple computing cores on a single processing chip where each core appears as a separate CPU to the operating system.
- These systems are referred to as **multicore** and **multithreaded programming** provides a mechanism for more efficient use of these multiple computing cores and improved concurrency**.**

### Concurrency vs Parallelism

- A concurrent system **supports more than one** task by allowing all the tasks to make progress.
- In contrast, a parallel system can perform **more than one task simultaneously**.
- Thus, it is possible to have concurrency without parallelism.

### Programming Challenges

- Multicore or multiprocessor system puts pressure on programmers, challenges include:
    - **Identifying Tasks**
        - This involves examining applications to find areas that can be divided into separate, concurrent tasks.
    - **Balance**
        - While identifying tasks that can run in parallel, programmers must also ensure that the task performs equal work of equal value.
    - **Data Splitting**
        - Just as applications are divided into separate tasks, the data accessed and manipulated by the task must be divided to run on separate cores.
    - **Data Dependency**
        - The data accessed by the tasks must be examined for dependencies between two or more tasks.
        - When one task depends on data from another, programmers must ensure that the execution of the tasks is synchronized to accommodate the data dependency.
    - **Testing and Debugging**
        - When a program is running in parallel on multiple cores, many different execution paths are possible.
        - Testing and debugging such concurrent programs is inherently more difficult that testing and debugging single-threaded applications.

## Types of Parallelism

In general, there are two types of parallelism:

- **Data Parallelism:**
    - Focuses on distributing subsets of the same data across multiple computing cores and performing the same operation on each core.
- **Task Parallelism:**
    - It involves distributing not data but tasks (threads) across multiple computing cores.
    - Each thread is performing a unique operation.

## Multithreading Models

- Support for threads may be provided either at the user level, for **user threads,** or for the **kernel threads** by the kernel**.**
- **User Threads:**
    - Supported **above** the kernel
    - Management done by user-level threads library
- **Kernel Threads**
    - Supported **by** the Kernel
    - Examples - virtually all general-purpose operating systems.

User and Kernel threads

- A **relationship** must exist between user threads and kernel threads and kernel threads.
- **Three** Common ways of establishing such as relationship:
    - **Many-To-One Model**
        
        - Many user-level threads mapped to a single kernel thread
        - Switch between threads fast (resources shared)
        - The kernel sees user threads as one process â†’ cannot take advantage of MP architecture.

        Many-To-One Model
        
- **One-To-One**
    
    - Each user-level thread maps to the kernel thread
    - Takes **advantage** of MP architecture
    - Context Switch **Slow**

    One-To-One Model
    
- **Many-To-Many**
    
    - Allows many user-level threads to be mapped to many kernel threads
    - Takes **advantage** of MP architecture
    - Context switch **faster** than one-to-one

## Threading Issues

### The `fork()` and `exec()` System Calls

- If one thread in one program calls `fork()`, does the new process duplicate all threads, or is the new process single-threaded?
- Some UNIX systems have chosen to have two versions of `fork()` one that duplicates all threads and another that duplicates only the thread that invoked the `fork()` system call.

### Signal Handling

- A **signal** is used in UNIX system to notify a process that a particular event has occurred.
- All signals, whether synchronous or asynchronous, follow the same pattern:
    - A signal is generated by the occurrence of a particular event.
    - The signal is delivered to a process.
    - Once delivered, the signal must be handled.

### Thread Cancellation

- **Thread Cancellation** involves terminating a thread before it has been completed.
- For example, if multiple are concurrently searching through a database and one thread returns the result, the remaining threads might be canceled.
- A thread that is to be canceled is often referred to as the **target thread.** The cancellation of a target thread may occur in two different scenarios:
    - **Asynchronous Cancellation:** One thread immediately terminates the target thread
    - **Deferred Cancellation:** The targeted thread periodically checks whether it should terminate, allowing it an opportunity to terminate itself in an orderly fashion.
