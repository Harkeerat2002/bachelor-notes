# Costs:
- ## Cost Categories in Typical IT Budgets:
	- Broad range of different costs categories
	- Main cost driver are **internal** and **external staff**, followed by licenses, and services.
	- The services categories can be expected to grow with the adoption of more **SaaS / PaaS** (Software-as-a-Service, Platform-as-a-service) offerings.
	- **License's categories** can be expected grow with companies adopting more standard software, except when they use it in a SaaS model.
- ## Activities in Operations:
	- **Infrastructure Provisioning:**
		- Installing and configuring hardware, network, and infrastructure software (operating system, database systems, etc.)
	- **Software Deployment:**
		- Installing and configuring application software on the infrastructure.
		- Distributing software to distributed devices (e.g. PCs, mobile phones, remote industrial devices)
	- **Systems Management / Monitoring:**
		- Monitoring running application and infrastructure software.
		- Identifying issues and outages
		- Taking corrective actions
	- **User Support / Helpdesk:**
		- Handling user questions and issue reports

- ## Maintenance of Application Software:
	- ![[Pasted image 20230504150125.png]]
	- More time is spent **understanding** the **application** and the **source code** itself. 
	- **Operations** is the largest cost block.
- ## Corollary for IT Investments:
	- The cost structure in IT is largely a reflection of past IT investment decisions, and very hard to change as long as the respective applications are being used.
	- If an application is decided to be implemented today, it is usually given that there will be operations and maintenance costs when it is used in the future, which is largely fixed.
	- Usually the maintenance cost is **10% - 15%** of original investment costs annually.
- ## Lifecycle Costs of Applications over 10 Years:

	- Put the different benefits and costs on a timeline, distinguishing when they will be incurred.
	- If there are large risks or uncertainties, use ranges for the figures and perform a sensitivity analysis with best-case, worst-case, and expected scenarios.
- ## Components of a Business Case:
	- **Benefits:**
		- All the benefits obtained from the project or the investment.
		- Quantified and separated for every year in which is is planned to be used.
		- Cost Reduction

		- *Ongoing Costs in Business:* Some projects lead to additional business costs once in use.

	- **Risks:**
		- *Project Risks:* Risks that will endanger the project.
		- *Operational Risks:* Specific additional risks in the business once the resulting application is live.
- ## Use of Business Cases:
	- Establishment of approval thresholds.
