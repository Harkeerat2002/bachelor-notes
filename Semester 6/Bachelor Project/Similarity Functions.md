# Different Similarity Functions:
Similarity functions are mathematical functions that measures the similarity between two objects or data points. The functions tends to takes the input data and produces a numerical score that reflects how similar or dissimilar the objects are.
- ## Similarity Functions being used:
	- ### Cosine Similarity:
		- Measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors.
	- ### Jaccard Similarity (Implemented):
		- Calculates the intersection divided by the union of the two sets.
	- ### Euclidean Distance:
		- Measures the distance between two points in space.
	- ### Pearson Correlation:
		- Measures the correlation between two variables. 
	- ### Dice Similarity Coefficient: 
		- Similar to Jaccard Similarity Coefficient, but is used to compare two sets of binary data.
